UbuntuPaste
===========

A command line interface for [Ubuntupaste](http://paste.ubuntu.com)

This is a very small gadget I developed for myself when I'm
working under SSH on the server. This made sharing small config
files a lot easy when you're on the terminal.

## Usage:

<up> [OPTION]... FILENAME...

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TYPE, --type=TYPE  specify type of target file
  -b, --browser         open response url in browser


## Install:

To be released as python package

## TODO:

Though this gadget is quite small, it's still under heavy development.
See TODO.org for more details, and see if you can contribute :)
